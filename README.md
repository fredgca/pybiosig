pyBioSig is tool for the identification of putative biosignatures from transcriptomical data. It employs genetic algorithms as gene selector and optimizes intra-group cohesion and inter-group dispersion. Python is the main programming language and R is the statistical framework. 

In case you want more details about the project you can see our paper "pyBioSig: optimizing group discrimination using genetic algorithms for biosignature discovery" at https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08911
